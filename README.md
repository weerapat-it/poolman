# Using Firebase's ML Kit in Flutter

A Flutter project meant to demonstrate simple usage outline for Firebase.

## Getting Started

Reference the following packages in your [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml):
- [camera](https://pub.dev/packages/camera)
- [firebase_ml_vision](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_ml_vision)
- [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)

Ensure your project has been properly converted to AndroidX.

Ensure you have a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account as well as a project for this example. Go through the process of registering your application as well as downloading the .json file to your project.
